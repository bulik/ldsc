# LDSC (LD SCore) `v1.0.0`

`ldsc` is a command line tool for estimating heritability and genetic correlation from GWAS summary statistics. `ldsc` also computes LD Scores.

## Getting Started



In order to download `ldsc`, you should clone this repository via the commands
```  
git clone https://github.com/bulik/ldsc.git
cd ldsc
```

In order to install the Python dependencies, you will need the [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) Python distribution and package manager. After installing Anaconda, run the following commands to create an environment with LDSC's dependencies:

```
conda env create --file environment.yml
source activate ldsc
```

Once the above has completed, you can run:

```
./ldsc.py -h
./munge_sumstats.py -h
```
to print a list of all command-line options. If these commands fail with an error, then something as gone wrong during the installation process. 

Short tutorials describing the four basic functions of `ldsc` (estimating LD Scores, h2 and partitioned h2, genetic correlation, the LD Score regression intercept) can be found in the wiki. If you would like to run the tests, please see the wiki.

## Updating LDSC

You can update to the newest version of `ldsc` using `git`. First, navigate to your `ldsc/` directory (e.g., `cd ldsc`), then run
```
git pull
```
If `ldsc` is up to date, you will see 
```
Already up-to-date.
```
otherwise, you will see `git` output similar to 
```
remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.

which tells you which files were changed. If you have modified the `ldsc` source code, `git pull` may fail with an error such as `error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:`. 

In case the Python dependencies have changed, you can update the LDSC environment with

```
conda env update --file environment.yml
```

## Where Can I Get LD Scores?

You can download [European](https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/LDSCORE/eur_w_ld_chr.tar.bz2) and [East Asian LD Scores](https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/LDSCORE/eas_ldscores.tar.bz2) from 1000 Genomes [here](https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/LDSCORE/). These LD Scores are suitable for basic LD Score analyses (the LD Score regression intercept, heritability, genetic correlation, cross-sex genetic correlation). You can download partitioned LD Scores for partitioned heritability estimation [here](http://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/LDSCORE/).
