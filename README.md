What is LD Score?
--------------

LD Score is a measure of the amount of linkage disequilibrium (LD) around a SNP. 
LD Score allows one to properly take LD into account when attempting to make 
inferences about the genetic architecture of complex disease using GWAS summary 
statistics.

What can I do with LDSC?
---------------------

1. Estimate LD Score (and other, more exotic moments of the genotype distribution).
2. Estimate heritability from GWAS summary statistics.
3. Estimate partitioned heritability from GWAS summary statistcs.
4. Estimate genetic covariance / correlation from GWAS summary statistics.
